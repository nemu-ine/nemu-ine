### Welcome to my profile!

I'm mainly a Java developer, I work with Spring Boot framework, as Java was my first programming language. During free time I like to experiment around with C/C++ using Qt framework. Programming is the greatest tool a man could have, with enough work you can automatize anything. Feel free to check out my projects!

I'm a friendly person and I love to help out where I can, so feel free to ask me for a code review or solving an issue you have!

### My projects

[flight-planner](https://github.com/nemu-ine/flight-planner): Simple REST api application where you can switch between in-memory storage and database storage. Contains admin API and user API, admin API requires authentication, as it has set up Spring Security. You can add/remove flights, search flights by the airports or departure dates with the admin API. Users can search for flights, or see all outgoing flights.

[user-task-manager](https://github.com/nemu-ine/user-task-manager): Simple terminal-based task managing application where you can access your set up database with ease. Uses JPA and PostgreSQL to communicate with each other. You can add/remove tasks, search for a task, mark a task complete and implement more features on top. Contains a simple SQL script.

[banking-manager](https://github.com/nemu-ine/banking-manager): Spring Boot REST api application using JPA and PostgreSQL that keeps track of user balance, if they took a loan and how much they have to pay back, automatical loan payment, user authentication and much more. Currently work in progress. Will contain SQL scripts for easy setup.
